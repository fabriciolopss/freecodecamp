        <section class = "main-section" id = "Variables_and_Data_Types">
        <header>Variables and Data Types</header>
        <p>In Python, variables are named storage locations used to store values. Variable names follow certain naming conventions and should be descriptive.
            Python has several built-in data types, including numbers, strings, and collections like lists and dictionaries.
            In Python, type conversion is automatic and can be performed using type conversion functions like int(), float(), and str().
            Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning that the type of a variable can change during the execution of the program.
        </p>

        <section class = "main-section" id = "Operators_and_Expressions">
            <header>Operators and Expressions</header>
            <p>Python has several types of operators, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, and more.
                Expressions in Python are constructed using these operators and can be used to perform operations like addition, comparison, and logical evaluations.
                In Python, short-circuit evaluation is used to optimize the evaluation of logical expressions.
            </p>

        <section class = "main-section" id = "Control_Structures">
            <header>Control Structures</header>
            <p>
                Python has several control structures, including if-else statements, for loops, while loops, and more, that allow you to control the flow of execution of your program.
The break and continue statements are used to prematurely exit a loop or skip to the next iteration, respectively.
The pass statement is a placeholder statement used when a statement is required syntactically, but you don't want any code to be executed.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class = "main-section" id = "Functions">
            <header>Functions</header>
            <p>
                Functions in Python are used to encapsulate reusable code and improve modularity.
Functions are defined using the def keyword and can accept arguments and return values.
The scope of a variable in Python refers to the region of the program where it is accessible. Variables defined inside a function have local scope and cannot be accessed outside the function.
Recursive functions are functions that call themselves, and are used to solve problems where the solution can be expressed in terms of a smaller version of the same problem.
Anonymous functions, also known as lambda functions, are one-line functions that can be defined without a name and are often used as arguments to other functions.

        <section class = "main-section" id = "Strings">
            <header>Strings</header>
            <p>
                Strings in Python are sequences of characters and are defined using quotes.
String indexing and slicing can be used to access specific characters or substrings within a string.
Python has several built-in methods for manipulating strings, such as concatenation, repetition, and more.
String formatting is a way to dynamically create strings using placeholders and variables.
String comparison can be performed using comparison operators and is case-sensitive by default.
            </p>

            <code>
                s = "string" <br>
                s = 'string' <br>
                s = '''string''' <br>
                s = """string""" <br>

            <header>Sets</header>
            <p>
                Sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements and are defined using curly braces {}.
Python has several built-in methods for manipulating sets, such as union, intersection, difference, and more.
Sets can be used to perform mathematical set operations, such as union, intersection, and difference.
